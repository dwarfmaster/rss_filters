RSS filters
=================

This project maintains filters to be used with newsbeuter. There is only one
executable, and every filter has a name that must be passed as first argument
of the executable when used. Any following argument is used as argument for
the filter.

It can be used to follow the following websites :
 - http://www.mangareader.net/ : it can follow any manga stored on this website
                                 (name `mangareader`).
 - http://www.mangahere.co/ : same goes for this one (name `mangahere`)
 - http://www.mangainn.me/ : idem (name `mangainn`)
 - renaming : can change the name of a feed (name `rename`), expect one argument,
              the new name of the feed
