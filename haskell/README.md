RSS filters
=================

This project maintains filters to be used with newsbeuter. There is only one
executable, and every filter has a name that must be passed as first argument
of the executable when used.

It can be used to follow the following websites :
 - http://www.mangareader.net/ : it can follow any manga stored on this website
                                 (name `mangareader`).
 - http://www.mangahere.co/ : same goes for this one (name `mangahere`)
 - http://www.mangainn.me/ : idem (name `mangainn`)
